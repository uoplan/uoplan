/**
 * The school (university) registry.
 *
 * uoplan started as a University of Ottawa planner, so for a long time every
 * layer silently assumed one institution: one catalogue, one set of `.pb`
 * assets, one course-code shape, one credit system. Supporting a second school
 * (Carleton) means that assumption has to become an explicit, typed dimension
 * that the scrapers, the data client, the store, the router, and the worker all
 * agree on.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for it. It lives in `@uoplan/domain`
 * — the bottom of the package graph — so every other package can depend on it
 * without inverting the layering.
 *
 * Nothing here is allowed to import from a higher layer, and nothing here may
 * hold user-facing prose that needs translation beyond the school's own proper
 * names (which are not translated — "Carleton University" is "Carleton
 * University" in both locales, and uOttawa's French name is a fixed proper noun).
